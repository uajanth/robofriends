# RoboFriends
[Live Demo](https://uajanth.github.io/robofriends/)

This project was a part of the "Zero To Mastery - Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery" course. In the course, the instructor (Andrei) uses a mix of functional and class based components to create his version of this application. However, I added my own twist to this project by building out this application with just class based components. I have previous experience building React applications using functional components, however I used this project as an opportunity to learn how to build class based components in React. While I feel confident working with functional components (building and reading code), I haven't been exposed to class based components much. This application was just a simple throw-away project, but I chose to upload this to my github profile because I want to be able to gain exposure to version control with git. Additionally, I want to have a way to track the progress I make in my self-taught development journey.
